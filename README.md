# Demo

In our demo, there is a collaborator and a player. The player is in VR and stands on a platform and shoots paintballs at targets that pop up around the player. The color of the targets is randomized between red, blue, green, and white. In order to successfully destroy a target, the color of the paintball on the gun must match the color on the target. To change the color of the gun, the collaborator must use a web interface with four colored buttons. Success relies on the collaboration between the player and collaborator. 

Additionally, a separate web interface updates a scoreboard which keeps track of how many targets of each color are destroyed.

The variable that keeps track of the paintball color is DecalColor.

The controls in the demo are set up to work with the HTC Vive. 

This demo has been tested with UnrealEngine 4.11

Side note: our demo includes a 2016 U.S. presidential election theme related to the colors with blue representing Democrats, red representing Republicans, green representing the Green Party, and white representing Independents. This theme was used while presentingat a project fair.
